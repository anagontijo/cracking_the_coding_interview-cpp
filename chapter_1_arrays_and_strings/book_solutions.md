# Book Solutions
## 1.1 Is Unique
### The difference to my solution in the book solution is:
    - I should have verified the length of the string , if it is greater than the alphabet used I can return false.
## 1.2 Check Permutation
### Problems in my solution:
    - Didn't ask if it was case sensitive (if it was I can simply make the string all up or down case)
    - Didn't ask if whitespace was significant, easily treated also.
    - Didn't realize that if they have the same size and the second word doesn't have more of any character than the first word than it is 
    impossible for the first word to have more of any character.
### The first idea of the book solution is to sort the string and than compare if they are equal. It is a simple and clean algorithm.
